## How To Open Rov Controller (Qt UI)

When you open Rov Controller, it will ask you to type Master Url and Host IP.
Master Url is url that appears to you when you run `roscore` command, which is the url of ros master.
Host IP is the ip of your device (device that you are running ROV Controller on).
